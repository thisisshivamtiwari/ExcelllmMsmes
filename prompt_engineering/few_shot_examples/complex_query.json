  "methodology": [
    "Filter quality_control data for Product = 'Widget-A'",
    "Group the data by Line (Line-1 and Line-2)",
    "Calculate the average Rework_Count for each line",
    "Compare the average Rework_Count between the two lines"

  "explanation": "This query filters by product, groups by line, and calculates average rework count. Uses simple WHERE clause with OR condition for multiple lines."
