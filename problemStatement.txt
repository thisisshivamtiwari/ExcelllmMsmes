LLM-Based Excel Assistant for MME Shopfloor Analytics (ExcelLLM)
Problem Statement:
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) generate large volumes of operational data in the form of Excel sheets, including production logs, quality inspection data, maintenance records, and inventory updates. However, manual data analysis in these spreadsheets is time-consuming and error-prone, limiting timely decision-making and efficiency improvements.
The objective of this project is to develop a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) capable of understanding and interpreting Excel-based shopfloor data. The model should accept natural language queries such as:
"Which product had the most rework this quarter?"
"Show daily production efficiency trends for Line 3."
"Summarize rejected batches by defect type."
The SLM must process these queries, analyze structured Excel data, and generate accurate, interpretable responses including text summaries, key metrics, and visual reports using open-source and free resources.
Deliverables:
• Fine-tuned on MME shopfloor data using LoRA or PEFT on a free open-source model (e.g.,
Llama 2, Mistral, or Falcon).
• Automatic Excel file parsing, normalization, and semantic indexing.
• Natural language query input → model-generated structured output.
• Automatic generation of charts, tables, and performance summaries.
• Evaluation metrics (accuracy, response relevance, latency, interpretability).
Dataset Description:
• Collection of Excel files representing MSME operational data (production logs, inventory sheets,
QC reports).
• Annotated training pairs of natural language queries and expected tabular outputs.
• Dataset size: ~2,000 query-output pairs across 50-100 Excel sheets.
